Docker Server Manager Go MCP (DSM) is a comprehensive Go-based REST API that provides a powerful and flexible interface for managing Docker containers, images, volumes, networks, and Docker Compose deployments.

## Overview

This project offers a complete solution for Docker management through a web API, featuring JWT authentication, robust CRUD operations, and support for all major Docker functionality. The API supports both PostgreSQL and SQLite databases for persistent storage, managed automatically using GORM.

### Key Features

- **Complete Docker Management**:
  - Container lifecycle management (create, start, stop, remove)
  - Image operations (pull, build, tag, remove)
  - Volume management (create, list, remove)
  - Network operations (create, connect containers, remove)
  - File operations (copy to/from containers)
  - Command execution within containers

- **Docker Compose Support**:
  - Parse and validate Docker Compose YAML files
  - Deploy multi-container applications
  - Track deployment status
  - Scale services up or down
  - Manage resources created by Compose deployments

- **Security**:
  - JWT authentication and authorization
  - Role-based access control
  - Token blacklisting and refresh
  - Password hashing and secure storage

- **API**:
  - RESTful API design with Gin framework
  - Comprehensive API documentation
  - Client SDK for Go applications
  - Swagger/OpenAPI specification

- **Database Support**:
  - PostgreSQL for production environments
  - SQLite for development and testing
  - Automatic schema migrations
  - GORM-based data access layer
